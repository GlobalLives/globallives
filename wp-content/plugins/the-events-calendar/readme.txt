The Events Calendar is a carefully crafted, extensible plugin that lets you easily share your events. Beautiful. Solid. Awesome.

== Description ==

Create and manage events with ease. Get professional-level quality and features backed by a team you can trust. The Events Calendar will help you kick ass.

The Events Calendar is built and supported by WordPress artisans Modern Tribe. Looking for additional functionality including recurring events, ticket sales, publicly submitted events, new views, Facebook event integration and more? <a href="http://m.tri.be/2a">Check out the available add-ons.</a>

= BUILT SOLID & SUPPORTED =

The Events Calendar is crafted the WordPress way.

The Events Calendar has been audited by many of the industry's WordPress experts including core developer Mark Jaquith for security & plugin review team member Pippin Williamson for best practices and plugin compatibility.

We've poured hundreds of hours into QA by a dedicated support team, monthly usability tests to guarantee that it's easy to use, and numerous user interviews to make sure you get what you want. We care about quality and crafting products that thrive in the wild.

The team at Modern Tribe stands by our work and offers light support every Wednesday to the community via the WordPress.org support forums. Feel free to ask a question if you're having a problem with implementation or if you find bugs. Looking for help NOW or need a deeper level of support? Add the <a href="http://m.tri.be/2c">premium add-on plugin</a> and you get access to premium support forums with under 24hr response times on weekdays.

= PLUG-N-PLAY & HIGHLY CUSTOMIZABLE =

The Events Calendar is built to work out of the box: it doesn’t use a shortcode (nor is one available). Just turn it on, configure the settings to match your needs and you'll be making events within less than 5 minutes.

By developers, for developers...it's ready to be the foundation for your wildest hack sessions. Complete with a skeleton stylesheet to theme fast and efficiently, loads of tools including partial template overrides, a host of template tags, hooks and filters, <a href="http://m.tri.be/eu">careful documentation</a>, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/moderntribe">library of code snippets</a> on GitHub. The Events Calendar is built FOR people who build websites.

Whether your vision is big or small, we have you in mind.

We've scaled The Events Calendar to work on a network with over 25 million unique visitors per month and hundreds of thousands of events. We have it running for Fortune 100 companies. Major universities, government institutions and some seriously bad ass startups push their events with our platform. Thousands of churches, eateries, small businesses, musicians, venues, and non-profits are publishing and promoting their events with The Events Calendar. You're in good company.

= FEATURES =

Whether you're operating a hyperlocal hub listing thousands of events, a university with many thousands of users, or you're a sole business owner listing your classes, The Events Calendar has your back.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a shortcode available for The Events Calendar? =

No, this plugin does not use a shortcode nor is one available at the time being. However, you may want to check out the experimental, totally unsupported <a href=“https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-rocket/“>Event Rocket add-on</a> to see if it accomplishes your shortcode needs.

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of The Events Calendar (3.6 as of this release). If you're running Events Calendar PRO it needs to match the version number of The Events Calendar. And if you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar 3.6 is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fourteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say "tough luck" if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

Users of the free The Events Calendar should post their questions in the plugin's <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/">WordPress.org forum</a>, which we hit about once a week (on Wednesdays). Please make sure to read <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/welcome-the-events-calendar-users-read-this-first">our sticky post</a> providing an overview of the support we provide free users BEFORE posting. If you find you're not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a PRO license.

If you're already a PRO user, you're entitled access to our more actively-monitored <a href="http://m.tri.be/2r">PRO forums</a> at the tri.be website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 24-48 hours during the business week. 

= Events Calendar PRO looks awesome! I'm sold! How can I get my hands on it? =

Events Calendar PRO can be purchased directly at the <a href="http://m.tri.be/54">tri.be website.</a> There are three (3) license types available, and all licenses include 1 year of access to support + updates.

= I'm interested in PRO or another add-on, but there are a few questions I've got before making the purchase. Can you help me get those addressed? =

Absolutely. If you're not finding your questions answered on the product pages, hit up our <a href="http://m.tri.be/2w">pre-sale forum</a> at the tri.be site. You can save yourself some time by reviewing the threads first to verify if your question has already been asked. If it hasn't, post a new thread as a guest. We'll get you a reply as quickly as we can, so you can make an informed decision regarding purchase. Keep in mind that the pre-sale forum is available for questions related to any premium product we've got: Events Calendar PRO, Eventbrite Tickets, WooCommerce Tickets, EDD Tickets, Shopp Tickets, WPEC Tickets, Community Events, Facebook Events and Filter Bar.

If your question is simple and can be addressed in 140 characters, you can always ask it <a href="http://twitter.com/moderntribeinc">on Twitter</a>.

== Versioning ==

Curious about our versioning process, and how it's changed since The Events Calendar 3.0's launch? Look no further.

As a general practice, version numbers for The Events Calendar, Events Calendar PRO and our other add-ons follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Semantic_versioning">Semantic Versioning guidelines</a> whenever practical.

This means releases will maintain a three-part version number: major version; minor version; and patch. Let's say we're looking at The Events Calendar 3.1, as an example:

Major version = 3
Minor version = 1
Patch = 0

If we deployed a follow-up maintenance build that addressed a couple small bugs, and called it 3.1.1, we'd now have:

Major version = 3
Minor version = 1
Patch = 1

At no point during the 3.0 lifecycle will the major version change. But you can expect that either minor version and/or patch will change with each release. 

== Changelog ==

== Help ==

Welcome to The Events Calendar, a full-featured events management system for WordPress. Thank you so much for using the labor of our love. We are Modern Tribe and we are here to help you kick ass.

If you aren't familiar with The Events Calendar, check out our <a href="http://m.tri.be/2p">new user primer.</a> It'll introduce you to the basics of what the plugin has to offer and will have you creating events in no time. From there, the resources below -- extensive template tag documentation, FAQs, video walkthroughs and more -- will give you a leg up as you dig deeper.

Additional resources available include:

* <a href="http://m.tri.be/eu">Documentation</a>
* <a href="http://m.tri.be/2n">FAQ</a>
* <a href="http://m.tri.be/2t">Help Videos</a>

* <a href="http://m.tri.be/2v">Release Notes</a>
* <a href="http://m.tri.be/2r">Forums</a>

We hit the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/">The Events Calendar forum here on WordPress.org</a> about once a week, assisting users with basic troubleshooting and identifying bugs that have been reported. (If you are looking for more active support, might we suggest buying a PRO license? Our team hits the <a href="http://m.tri.be/2r">PRO forums</a> daily.)

Some things to consider before posting on the forum:

* Look through existing threads before posting a new one and check that there isn't already a discussion going on your issue.
* Your issue will be solved more quickly if you run a few checks before making a support request. Deactivate your plugins one by one - if the issue is fixed by deactivating a plugin you know you've got a plugin conflict. To test your Theme, revert to the default Twenty Twelve Theme to see if you are still experiencing the problem. If not, your Theme is the issue. Please provide this information when making your supper request.
* Sometimes, just resetting your permalinks can fix the issue. Visit Events -> Settings -> Permalinks, save your permalinks with a different option and then save with your preferred choice again. This can solve events-related problems and can is worth a shot before creating a new thread.

Still not happy? Shoot us an email to pro@tri.be or tweet to @moderntribeinc and tell us why. We'll do what we can to make it right.

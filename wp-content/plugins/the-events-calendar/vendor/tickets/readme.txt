Event Tickets allows your visitors to RSVP to events on your site.  Also works seamlessly with <a href="http://m.tri.be/18tg">The Events Calendar</a>.

== Description ==

><strong>A note about support:</strong> We’re here to help troubleshoot bugs, but should set expectations early that the support forums at WordPress.org are only checked once a week.
>
> Users looking for more timely/in-depth support are encouraged to check out <a href="http://m.tri.be/18th" target="_blank" title="[new window]">Event Tickets Plus</a>.

Event Tickets provides a simple way for visitors to RSVP to your events. As a standalone plugin, it enables you to add RSVP functionality to posts or pages. When paired with The Events Calendar, you can add that same RSVP functionality directly to your event listings.

Admins are able to access RSVP information from the backend, allowing them to check in registered attendees with ease when your event begins. For free events, Events Tickets allows you to own the entire event management process within your WordPress site.

= BUILT SOLID & SUPPORTED =

The team at Modern Tribe stands by our work and offers light support every Wednesday to the community via the WordPress.org support forums.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

Users of the free plugin can post in the Event Tickets support forum on WordPress.org: https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/event-tickets/. Our team reviews that forum weekly to look for bug reports. If you need more in-depth help, consider purchasing a license for <a href="http://m.tri.be/18th">Tickets Plus</a>. A valid license gives you access to our <a href="http://m.tri.be/18u1">premium support forums</a> which are checked daily.

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of Event Tickets. If you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just Event Tickets is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say "tough luck" if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

If you're an Event Tickets Plus user, you're entitled access to our actively-monitored <a href="http://m.tri.be/18u1">forums</a> at the theeventscalendar.com website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. No post should go more than 24-48 hours during that time without a response.

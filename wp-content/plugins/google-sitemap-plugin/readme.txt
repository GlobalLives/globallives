== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I use this plugin? =

After opening the plugin settings page your Sitemap file will be created automatically. If you already have a Sitemap file and do not want to change it, just do not check off the field "I want to create a new sitemap file".

In order to add a path to your sitemap file in robots.txt you do not need to authorize via your Google Account, you should just select the necessary field and click "Save Changes" button. If you're using multisiting, the plugin does not allow to add a sitemap to robots.txt

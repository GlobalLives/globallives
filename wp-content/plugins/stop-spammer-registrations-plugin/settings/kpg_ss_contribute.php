<p>If you wish to support my programming, anything you can do would be appreciated.</p>
<p>There are four ways to do this.</p>
<p>First, you can go to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/stop-spammer-registrations-plugin" target="_blank">plugin pages on WordPress.org</a> and click on a few stars for the plugin rating, and check off the "it works" information. You might, if so moved, say a few nice words under reviews.</p>
<p>Second, you can link to this website somewhere on your blog. The incoming links help with Google searches.</p>
<p>Third, If you feel that you'd like to encourage me, you could <a href="#books">buy one of my books</a>. I write short stories for fun and I have sold about 50 stories to various magazines. The books are cheap and very interesting.</p>
<p>You can also donate a few dollars. Cash is a little short right now, so my wife convinced me to go the low road and ask for money. There are three levels of donations. First, at $2.50 you can support me. I like this level because it does not put any stress on you. I think everyone can afford this without any pain. Second, for those who think they owe a little more, I have a $9.99 level. This is for those who have money to burn and drive expensive sports cars. Last, there is the $29.99 level. I don't expect anyone to use this level, but there are possibly a few sysops with a company credit card, and an unlimited budget who might sympathize with a fellow coder and click this button.</p>
<p>You can pay using PayPal. All you need is a credit card. There is no account required. Just click and follow the instructions. You can request a refund and I will gladly comply.

<p> For those of you out there that are a crazy as I am, I am offering the ability to make a donation bitcoins. I love the idea of bitcoins, but have, as yet, not found a use for them. If I had some, I would use them to donate to websites like mine.</p>
<a class="coinbase-button" data-code="32b243fd872e58ad5044fa7b8399bc80" data-button-style="donation_large" href="https://www.coinbase.com/checkouts/32b243fd872e58ad5044fa7b8399bc80">Donate Bitcoins</a>
<script src="https://www.coinbase.com/assets/button.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<br>
If you sign up for <a href="https://coinbase.com/?r=52dad5e334b3905bfe0000c3&amp;utm_campaign=user-referral&amp;src=referral-link">coinbase</a> using this link, I get $5 when you buy some bitcoins.
</p>
<p>I would like to thank you for your support. The very best way to support me is to report all bugs, ask for enhancements, send me your ideas, and drop me a line of encouragement. I will not get rich writing plugins, so you can help me by adding to the fun of coding. I have spent the last 40 years writing programs. I started in 1969 writing FORTRAN on an old IBM 1400, and I have learned every cool language that has appeared since. Programming has given me a good life and I would rather write code than almost anything.</p>

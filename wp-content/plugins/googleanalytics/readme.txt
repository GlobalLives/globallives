Use Google Analytics on your Wordpress site without touching any code, and view visitor reports right in your Wordpress admin dashboard!

== Description ==

Google Analytics plugin from ShareThis is the best way to add GA tracking code to your website without modifying any files. Just log in with Google right from your WP admin dashboard and choose which website you want to link. Then you can disable GA tracking of specific users, so that when you are browsing your own site it won't affect your analytics.

Also, you will be able to see Google Analytics reports in the same interface you already use every day to write and manage your posts - in your WordPress dashboard. Now you can stay informed on how your website is doing without having to log into a separate tool.

This Google Analytics plugin has a unique feature called Trending Content. It learns about your traffic patterns and shows you a list of content that is performing significantly better than average, so that you know what resonates with your audience the most. You can even sign up to receive alerts via email or Slack when content is taking off!

One more thing - unlike other plugins, Google Analytics for WordPress has no monthly fees, and no paid upgrades. All the features are totally free.

= Features: =
* Simple setup - Adds latest version of Google Analytics javascript to every page
* Account linking - no need to copy and paste any code or know your GA ID, just log in with Google, select the required website and it will automatically include the appropriate code
* Visitor trends - Shows a summary dashboard with page views, users, pages per session and bounce rate for the past 7 days as compared to the previous 7 days
* Traffic sources - Shows top 5 traffic sources so you know where your visitors are coming from
* Trending Content - Shows a history of content that is performing better than average, so at any given time you know what content resonates with your audience the most

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need to touch any code to add Google Analytics? =
Nope, just sign in with google, choose your website, and our plugin will automatically add Google analytics code to all pages.

= How do I make sure Google Analytics is properly installed on all pages? =
If you signed it with google and selected your website (or manually added the property ID) the Google Analytics javascript will be added to all pages. To check what UA code it is adding, just open any page of your website in Chrome, right click to select Inspect, navigate to Network tab, reload the page and search for googleanalytics, you will see the google code with your UA ID. <a href=”https://cl.ly/1q3o2q26261V/[e5b08a5ae1c09684a56ba14c36e6fa5c]_Screen%2520Shot%25202017-02-06%2520at%25201.57.34%2520PM.png” title=”Google Analytics code on the page example”>See example here.</a>

= I see broken formatting inside the plugin, for example some buttons are not aligned? =
This is likely caused by AdBlocker that is blocking anything related to "google analytics". Please disable AdBlocker for your own website or add it to exceptions if you are using Opera.

= How does that cool "Trending Content" feature work? =
It learns about your traffic patterns to spot "spikes" of visitors and then sends an alert. If your website doesn't have good amount of visitors you might not see any Trending Content Alerts because the algorithm needs more data to see "trends".

= I have other questions, where I can get support or provide feedback? =

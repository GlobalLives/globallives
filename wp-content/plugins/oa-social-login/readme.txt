== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to add template tags to my theme? =

The Social Login seamlessly integrates into your blog by using predefined hooks.

= Does Social Login can be embedded through a shortcode? =

The Social Login shortcode `[oa_social_login]` can be used in any page or post within your blog.
The shortcode will automatically be replaced by the icons of the chosen
social network providers.

= I have a custom template and the plugin is not displayed correctly =

The plugin uses predefined hooks. If your theme does not support these hooks,
you can add the Social Login form manually to your theme by inserting the following code 
in your template (at the location where it should be displayed, i.e. above the comments).

`<?php do_action('oa_social_login'); ?>`

If you encounter any problems with users having cyrillic characters in their
usernames, please consider installing the following plugin to fix the problem:

Exports your database, does a find and replace on URLs and file paths, then allows you to save it to your computer.

== Description ==

WP Migrate DB exports your database as a MySQL data dump (much like phpMyAdmin), does a find and replace on URLs and file paths, then allows you to save it to your computer. It is perfect for developers who need to update their local install with fresh data from the production site, or copy their locally developed site to a staging or production server.

It even takes into account serialized data (both arrays and objects) and updates the string length values.

Example: <code>s:5:"hello"</code> becomes <code>s:11:"hello world"</code>

== Installation ==

1. Use WordPress' built-in installer
2. Access the "Migrate DB" menu option under Tools

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin support multisite? =

Not at this time. The Developer license of the [pro version](http://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=web&utm_content=faq&utm_campaign=freeplugin) does support multisite.

= Does the plugin migrate files as well? =

No, it only operates on the database.

= Why do I end up with a wp-login.php download instead of the exported SQL file? =

It is likely you have a download manager plugin or extension installed in your web browser. You will need to disable it for the SQL download to work properly.

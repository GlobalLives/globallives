<div id="content">

<strong>The Global Lives Project is currently hiring graduate students, exceptional undergraduates or recent graduates in 2015 for volunteer internships.</strong>

Our internships offer a unique opportunity to learn from a diverse community of professionals from around the world working in a variety of disciplines. We have produced and shown our video work in more than a dozen countries and are growing quickly, and every internship opportunity will give interns the satisfaction of seeing their work have a major impact on a rapidly growing organization.

Internships are available for a duration of 3 - 6 months, at 10 - 20 hours/week. (For current students, internships require a commitment of a minimum of 150 hours, which is about 10 hours/week for 15 weeks or 20 hours/week for 8 weeks for summer internships.) Internships are located in San Francisco, with the possibility for remote work. Each intern will meet weekly with their supervisor in person or by phone/video. These are volunteer internships. Groups of 2-3 students are welcome to apply together for each project.

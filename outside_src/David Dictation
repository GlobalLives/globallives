so for me having Melissa Martin the UX designer say that she didn't really understand Global Lives until after she saw the exhibit but she had designed the whole website before she saw the exhibit... I felt that that was a big mistake on my part...

what is really can mean to get her to see the exhibit during the time that you were here also might be worth noting the pain method that worked on the exhibit have you heard of method before they're in San Francisco they're pretty well known in the sun world they did the website for CNN and ESPN and SF MoMA do a lot of product design stuff with Google so they did it all for free for Global Lives Project is a purple prom project they said it was about $200,000 worth of designer time...
